    <h1>Some of My Favorite Things</h1>
    <h3>Let's talk about what makes me happy</h3>
    <h2>Happy Things:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Candles</li>
        <li>Pecan Pie</li>
        <li>Apple picking</li>
        <li>Burritos</li>
        <li>Lava lamps</li>
      </ol>
    <p>The list could go on forever! Halloween and Christmas are approaching and off the top of my head, I can think of about 30 yummy treats and cute decorations! I have a strong urge to watch Hocus Pocus.</p>
