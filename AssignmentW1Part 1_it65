This has been my favorite blog for quite awhile now, but I've always admired their website and the setup. Despite it being a colorful page with many links, I think it is still very well organized. I really like how all of the top links, "Food"-"Our Color Story" stays in the same location as you scroll through the page, so it's easily accessable without having to scroll all the way back up. All of the colors work really well together based on the theme DIY and lifestyle.

This is another lifestyle blog that I have followed for awhile. It has changed a lot over the years, but I think its current UI is the best its ever been. I like that the homepage allows you to enter the blog, shop or tumblr. Many bloggers show have different wedsites or social media accounts and I've always liked when they put it all in one place for people to access. The mainpage itself is extremely simple, which is really nice when trying to navigate. I think it's always good to have a white background and links to subpages be different colors (blue, green, black, etc).

For the same reason I like the Folk website is why I like Trendland. I really like the white background with pictures/words that link to an article. One thing that I do dislike about this website is the placemet of the advertisements. I seems like they take up way more space than they should. Also, when changing the size of the screen, the setup of the website changes and does not look so good. It doesn't adapt too wel to mobile versions either. Instead of shrinking everything and just scrolling up and down, you have to move around to get from left to right as well.
