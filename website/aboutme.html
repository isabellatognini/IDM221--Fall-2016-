<h2>About Me</h2>

<p> I am a Philly girl, born and raised in Fishtown, Philadelphia. Up until now, I have always gone to a school in Philadelphia, from pre-school to college. I went to high school just nine blocks from Drexel University's campus, at Science Leadership Academy. Throughout high school I dreamed about getting out of Philadelphia and going to a small school in a rural area. After almost 20 college visits, I realized that city life is what I was meant for, so I decided to stay in my favorite city and go to my Mother's alma mater, Drexel University. </p>

<p>I started at Drexel University as a International Area Studies major, but soon decided that I wanted to follow in my Mother's footsteps and be a Marketing and Entrepreneurship duel major. My first co-op was in Brooklyn, NY where I worked for a small jewelry company as their social media and marketing intern for 6 months. During that co-op I decided to add a Interactive Digital Media minor. I felt like it would give me a step up in the marketing world by knowing the more technical side. </p>

<p>For my second co-op I decided to stay in Philadelphia and work at Connectify Inc., a networking software company as their social media and affiliate marketing manager. During this co-op I realized the benefits of combining marketing and digital media. At this point, I had just taken the introduction classes, but was able to do simple Photoshop and Illustrator editing for our UI and advertisements. </p>

<p>I draw my personal inspiration from others, whether it's through social media or from the people I meet. I find that I am on the more creative side of marketing, not so much the number and statistical side. It's enjoyable for me to see how people react to campaigns I've made or ways in which I have promoted an item. I hope someday to give a strong group of people to work together with to create something big and exciting.</p>
